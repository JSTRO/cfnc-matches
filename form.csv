",Extrovert,Extrovert,"Weekends for me a include a combination of “me” time and social time.  I make an effort to see friends and family. I usually do something chill during the day (work out, cook, errands). Saturday night I typically make the plans for the group. I invite friends out for group dinners, drinks, or dancing :) ",My friends know me as the one that brings people together. I love to host dinner parties and group outings. I make the plans for everyone and they follow. I am involved in various Jewish organizations and host events to recruit new faces to the community. I get joy seeing people connect and expand their circle of friends. ,"Fashion and business and how they are intertwined. The fashion industry is who I am... but I am also a very analytical person which is why I like to think I am business savvy. I recently left the corporate world to pursue my own business endeavors so I must keep myself up to date on the retail industry, business, and fashion brands. I love talking about the current events in the industry, why things are changing, and predict what will happen. ",Yes,4,I brush it under the rug until it blows over,"One of my recently discovered passions is being involved in Jewish events in NYC. Typically, organizations host Shabbat events or fundraisers that have an underlying social aspect to them. They are an opportunity to bring everyone together to teach traditional values or raise money for a cause. For me, these events do have some religious significance, but more importantly they have created a sense of community in my life that I was lacking in NYC. I now have a comfortable place with familiar faces that in a way, feels like a home away from home. I’m a huge proponent for others getting involved in the same way so they can create that same feeling for themselves. In the recent months I’ve been asked to join many host committees for these organizations. I am grateful for the opportunity to be recognized as someone that can give back to others the same feeling and sense of community that was extended to me. ","My friends tell me that I am very spontaneous and always down to do fun things. If they call me to do something, I’m usually down to try it, even if it’s new and unchartered territory. I am of the mindset of saying YES. ","Fashion industry entrepreneur, I own a women’s clothing boutique. I’m an Adjunct Professor at FIT. Teaching others gives me joy... I’m contributing something positive to their lives. I’m into fitness and health. Love cooking and hosting meals for friends + bringing people together. I’m down to earth and love connecting with people one-on-one in a deep conversation, about goals, life, family, travel... whatever the topic is. Stimulating conversation and mutual interests are very important to me in a partner. Laughter is my medicine. Travel and exploring culture is a huge passion of mine. Chivalry is not dead. Need a gentleman not a fuckboi. Looking for  someone who is confident, secure, appreciative, empathetic, and obviously someone who I am wildly attracted to. ",Friend,
